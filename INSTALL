# Compile the code
Before compiling the code, you need to make sure you have these installed:
libfreeimage3, libfreeimage-dev
or, you can manually download the FreeImage image and put into the lib folder.

# Convert image
The image originally output as pgm file, which cannot open by Windows Photos by default. So I added a python script to convert pgm file into png file, which you'll see the result easier.
The image convert tool needs:
- Python3
- PIL libaray
